import PackageDescription

// OpenimgKit is deliberately a plain SwiftPM library with no dependencies and
// no Xcode project: it builds from the command line, which is the only way CI
// (and contributors who are not on macOS) can touch it. The apps are thin.
//
// The checks live in an executable rather than a test target because both
// XCTest and swift-testing need a full Xcode install to resolve — with only
// the Command Line Tools present, `swift test` cannot compile at all, so a
// test target would be a set of assertions nobody ever runs. `swift run
// KitCheck` works anywhere Swift does. Add an XCTest target alongside it once
// Xcode is in the picture; this one still runs in CI without it.
let package = Package(
    name: "OpenimgKit",
    // macOS 14 for `inspector` and the two-parameter `onChange`; both are load
    // bearing in the gallery and neither has a clean pre-14 equivalent.
